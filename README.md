# Portfolio (HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a pixel-inspired reproduction of the provided Figma "Portfolio for Developers (Community)" template,
built with **vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript** and enhanced with:

- scroll-reveal animations
- active nav link highlighting
- mobile menu
- basic form validation

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

If you want a local server (recommended):
- VSCode: install **Live Server**, then right-click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server"
